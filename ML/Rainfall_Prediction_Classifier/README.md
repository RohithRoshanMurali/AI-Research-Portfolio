# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This project predicts rainfall occurrence using **machine learning classification algorithms**.  
It analyzes meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and pressure to forecast whether it will rain or not.

## 📊 Overview

- **Goal:** Predict rainfall occurrence (binary classification)
- **Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- **Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
- **Output:** “Rain Tomorrow” (Yes/No)
